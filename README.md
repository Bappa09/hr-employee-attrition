The project was created as a part of the INSAID capstone project to help HR faternity to detect possible employees who may end up quitting the organization.

The data was sourced from the HRMS where the details of all the past and current employees are being recorded for the last 15 years.

In this project the outcome is a classification where we judge if the employees is likely to quit or not.
